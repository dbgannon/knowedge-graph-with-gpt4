Heterogeneous knowledge graphs link node entities such as people, places, events  by  edges that correspond to semantic connections between  the nodes.  Together they can capture the total information about a topic of study such as European history or an enterprise like the government of a country.  The problem with these graphs is that it can be difficult to extract the knowledge to satisfy a query.   A large language model like GPT-4 can take vague natural language query and draw upon its vast exposure to text to formulate rather convincing responses.  Of course, the answer may be a brilliant hallucination.  But it is possible to link these two tools together.   In this note we illustrate how to do this using AutoGen, a multiagent toolkit from Microsoft Research for building applications from LLMs, to tie a simple knowledge graph, the ACM  paper citation graph, as the back end of a query tool based on GPT-4.
